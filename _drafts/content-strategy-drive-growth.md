metadescription: Learn how content strategy can help solopreneurs, startups and growing businesses drive growth.
excerpt: Many solopreneurs, startups and growing businesses overlook the importance of content, because they are focused on other matters. However, this leads ot lost sales and increased costs. In this chapter I’ll give you an overview of how you can make sure you have content that drives growth and increases productivity, as well as how you can make the business case for content strategy.

##What you'll learn in this blog post: 

* how quality content can drive growth
* how to create useful content that will help customers make a buying decision and encourage repeat purchases
* how to prioritise content creation when you have a limited budget
* how to sell content strategy to your colleagues, stakeholders and to yourself

###Why it matters: 

* Poor or inappropriate content will lose you the attention and trust of your audience
* Mediocre content, with poor information architecture, will fail to convert browsers to customers
* Content that doesn't make it obvious what a customer should do next leads to customer abandonment
* Inconsistent content – some good content and some poor – will confuse and frustrate customers
* Search engines penalise poor content so your search rankings will suffer

## Get the basics sorted first

Content is why people come to your website. They want to complete a
task, find information, be entertained, or a combination of all three.
If you make these goals even remotely difficult for them then they’ll
leave.

A customer doesn’t want to know everything about your company. She wants
the content she needs, when she needs it.

So, good content can help your company grow faster by getting the
attention of customers, answering their questions, and motivating them
to take specific actions.

In this chapter I’ll give you an overview of how you can make sure you have content that drives growth and increases productivity, as well as how you can make the business case for content strategy.

Let's begin by nailing down the fundamentals of your company. Sit down
with your team and discuss what the purpose of your product or service
is and what problem it solves. Even if you have been trading for three
years this can be a valuable exercise. Make sure all your stakeholders
are involved so you get everyone onboard now.

After this initial brain storming, you're ready to craft a core content
strategy statement. A core content strategy statement addresses issues
such as:

-   What content should we produce?
-   Who is that content for?
-   What’s the end result for us?

A tech startup that provides software for athletes in training might craft a statement like this one:

> “Increase signups by producing detailed and technical content that will provide ambitious amateur athletes with answers to their training questions.” 

Or a company selling GPS maps of the Australian outback might go for:

> "Increase sales by producing knowledgeable and helpful location-based content that provides adventurous travellers with the motivation and means to navigate the outback."


## Provide a consistently good experience

Companies often spend time and money on a few bits of content (usually a
homepage and a few other marketing pages) but don’t give much thought to
the rest of their content and how their content links up.

As a result, the overall user experience for your product or service can be inconsistent. This can lose you the trust of customers.

Just think for a minute: you’ve come across some cool software and the
marketing pages have been pretty persuasive. But you need to know if the
software works for your specific setup. The features page doesn’t quite
tell you but signposts the knowledge base.

So you head there only to find that it could have been written by a
different company. One that employs robots rather than copywriters. 

![](/images/robot.jpg)

<em>Don't frustrate your customers with copy that reads like it was written by a robot. <a href="https://flic.kr/p/aC43K2">photo credit</a>.</em>

You try and read the knowledge base article, give up, and start wondering if
maybe the product isn’t right for you after all. But you quite like it.

So you email customer service. And they say what a nice day it is and
how happy they are to help. By which time you feel like screaming. Then
they don’t really answer your question because it’s quite technical and
you get the feeling they haven’t really understood what you’ve asked.

Result: you decide to buy another product because you get the feeling
this company doesn’t really care about providing a great experience for
their customers.

Providing a consistently good experience across your content is more
important than having a few stand out pages of content and a lot of
dross.

Neglected content often includes

###Checkout pages 
<em>Pay pages that guide a customer through the process of giving you money.</em> 

Make sure that these are simple, easy to use and mobile-optimised. For example, if you are buying an ebook then you don't want to be asked for your address: this is confusing and unnecessary. Avoid checkout providers who are cheap (or free) but offer a very poor user experience. You'll end up losing money because of a poor customer conversion rate. <a href="https://www.sendowl.com/blog/how-to-improve-your-conversion-rate-part2.html">This article</a> I wrote for SendOwl offers some tips.

###Knowledge base content
<em>Help or support articles for new or potential customers.</em>

Support content is a great way to reduce the cost per customer of customer support. You basically encourage your customers to 'self-help' rather than contact you every time they have a question. Support content also has SEO value (often for long-tail key words) and can be a good way to convert customers who want detail. Good customer support content might include:

* Title
* Table of contents
* Use cases for this feature
* Video walkthrough
* Walkthrough with screenshots
* Related content

###Onboarding content 
<em>Emails and dashboard content that helps new customers find value in your product or service</em>

Getting value from your product is easy if you built it, but make sure that it's equally easy for your customers, particularly if they are on a free trial. Guide users towards useful actions that will benefit them. For example, I work with UXPin, a "full stack design platform" that helps me prototype websites, apps and so on. On my free trial I was encouraged to start a project when I logged in.

![](/images/uxpin-userinterface-3.png)

They also sent me a welcome email with a few more choices: Design from scratch, Import from Sketch & Photoshop, Get everyone on the same page and Start collaborative design. This gave me an idea of different use cases.

I created a project, enjoyed using the software – and signed up (which meant moving from a competitor). 

For an insight into <a href="http://www.useronboard.com/">how other companies use onboarding</a> have a look at this website.

###Customer support emails, phone calls and chat
<em>Reply to a question or query</em>

Although it's important that customers get support quickly, it's essential they get useful support. There's nothing more frustrating than spending 30 mins on the phone to someone (or spending half a day on email) and still not getting the answer you need.

Avoid contracting out support (especially choosing a company by price alone) unless you are 100% sure the support team get what you do, can genuinely help your customers and will work happily together with other team members. Otherwise they will cost you money in lost sales and inefficient company processes.

![](/images/phone.jpg)

<em>Even 24/7 phone support will go down badly with customers if your support team is not really very helpful. <a href="https://flic.kr/p/PxqzC">photo credit</a>.</em>

###Less prestigious website pages 
<em>Anything that you need to click a few links to find</em>

All content on your site should be valuable and serve a clear purpose. So don't create poor content because it 'doesn't really matter' or fail to revise content because 'no one will notice'. All your content matters and customers (and search engines) will notice if you skimp on 'less prestigious' pages. 

If you look at your analytics, you might also be surprised to see how high-performing some of your seemingly 'less prestigious' pages can be, perhaps because they have unexpected SEO value so lots of customers are landing on them or because they provide vital information that your customers need (but that you didn't know they needed).


###Microcopy and UI text 
<em>Labels on a form field, tiny pieces of instructional text, words on a button, field labels, error messages and confirmation text<em>

Microcopy and UI content can often get lost in the borderland between your content people, your user experience people and your design people. Who actually has responsibility for microcopy and UI? If no one takes responsibility then you can get all kinds of inconsistencies and flat out blunders.

![](/images/pet-perfect.png)

<em>This website tries to pre-empt your concerns about security and what happens next using microcopy</em>


###Social proof 
<em>Customer stories, video, testimonial, interviews, and so on</em>

You're probably well versed on the need to provide 'social proof' to potential customers that your company is credible and that your existing customers love your product. 

However, if you want to make the biggest impact with social proof, approach it strategically. Perhaps a longer case study detailing your work done for a client, or a series of videos about how customers use your product, would be a better fit for your company than the bite-size series of testimonials favoured by your main competitor?

![](/images/social-proof.png)

Intranet startup Interact chose this type of quick social proof on their homepage (you hover over a photo and the image flips to show a quick testimonial). They also have a customers page with 9 videos, logos of customers, a chance to browse customers by region, employees and sector, and video case studies. 

This seems like a lot of work, but the videos can be used on social media (particularly YouTube) to pull in potential customers. I'm sure they also recycle more of their social content. 

###Internal documentation about processes 
<em>Any documents meant for company eyes only, ranging from what holidays people can take, over-time, expenses, and so on, to 'how to' documentation about your social media strategy, message architecture, branding information, and so on</em>

This content is largely about saving your company time and money in terms of processes. Every internal query you have to answer about holidays or expenses, or how to use this piece of software, say, costs you money. So get your answers to these queries down in one place so you don't have to keep repeating yourself. 

Even if you only employ occasional freelancers, having good internal documentation will save you time and money. If you commission an illustrator to draw you a couple of animations they need guidance on your company messaging and visual branding. A virtual PA who helps you with organisational tasks needs to understand how your company works and what matters, so they know when to get your opinion on something and when to go with their own judgement. 

Companies scaling quickly also need to extract information from the brains of a small team of people so it can benefit new team members (and the company as a whole). It isn't fair to expect new members of the team to do marketing, social media, support, or whatever, as faultlessly as your initial team can. They need proper advice, guidelines and examples they can refer to - not a quick onboarding tour and job done.

Think about creating a wiki or perhaps a folder on a file sharing service like Dropbox for key team sections like: who we are & what we do, overall messaging, visual branding, social media, marketing, support, software, holidays, overtime & pay, and so on. However:

* make sure that someone has overall responsible for creating and curating this resource otherwise it will end up as an outdated mess

* consider what matters most to your company for internal documentation: privacy, a good search function, ability to share.... there are a lot of solutions on the market so a 'must have' list will help you winnow down the contenders


## Support your customers (not your internal lobbyists)

You want all your content to work together to support and nudge
customers through your sales funnel. This way what content you do have is
supercharged and offers the best return possible for your investment.

However, there are a few reason why your content might hinder growth rather than drive it, including:

* you don't understand who your customers are and what they need (see first chapter)
* your feel pressured by team members/departments to create certain content 
* you feel that websites should be arranged in a certain way (or the many people you consult have strong views on how a website should look, often opposing!)
* you have something really important to say about your business and that deserves top billing

Stand tall. You need to reject these pressures. Unless you give your customers what they need then your company – and every individual and team within it – is going to suffer. 

So, think about your customers and think about how they need to journey through your content (and that includes social media, print content, phone calls, text messages, and so on). Then, and only then, will you start creating content that will drive growth. 


Let's look at a website that I pays attention to what a customer needs rather than simply 'broadcasting' information about the company.

![](/images/brains-screenshot.png)

We'll take the site for a test drive: I'm a CTO with responsibility for overseeing our company's transition to <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">an agile methodology</a>. I've made a business case for getting some external training. Now I'm seeing what options are out there before pitching to our CEO.

I've landed on this page. There's a great big button at the top that says 'training: when you need to develop new skills'. Just what I wanted. I select this and am taken part way down the homepage to a section that tells me:

* whether we need training rather than coaching
* why training will benefit our company
* an example of courses offered

This section answers some of my questions. I've read enough that I want to find out more – so I select the handily placed 'find out more' link. 

Now I'm on a training landing page. What have we here?

* More content about why training is helpful 
* An 'action' plan that invites me to browse training courses by subject or structure. If I see something I like I can schedule a course without any more ado. If I think we need something more customised I can schedule an initial consultation

Useful. I browse by subject and spot the perfect course: "Making Your Agile Transition Work". This landing page tells me:

* The course is right for you, if…
* What you will learn…
* What we will do

This is sounding great. Just what we need. The 'schedule a course' button is obvious and tempting. I go for it.

Now I see this:

>You'd like to schedule some on-site training?
Fantastic! I look forward to talking to you about working together.
But first, I need to ask you a handful of questions in order to see how our schedules fit and to be able to answer (probably) the most urgent question you have: how much will it cost me?

Cool. I know our budget is realistic but I need to see the sums. I love that I'm not wasting time sending this guy loads of query emails as well. I answer all the questions: I'm led through them so there's no problem. I particularly like question 12: What, if anything, would you like tell me that I haven't asked you about?

I'm going to press 'submit'. We are go!

The site author knows exactly what we need: I know exactly what they offer. 

Job done. 

I can't believe how easy that was.

So, to recap:

* The site author has given a lot of thought to what his customers need and when. The homepage looks very simple (almost like a one-pager) but as you get deeper into the site you come across a lot of useful information. When you need it. And the author didn't feel the need to link to all of it from the homepage!
* The site author hasn't got bogged down in 'web conventions' – there is no top navigation, for example
* The site author has also give a lot of thought to what he needs (fewer exploratory and explanatory emails, phone calls and miscellaneous time wasting enquiries). So his web content is making him more productive.
* Although his content probably took a lot of work up front, in terms of researching his target audience and thinking strategically about what content they need when (i.e. how they will journey through his site), his hard work is paying dividends now. I bet his conversion rate is pretty good. 

As a contrast, let's have a quick look at a website that isn't so committed to the concept of the user journey.

![](/images/Sanofi.png)

I'll be the first to acknowledge that big corporations like this one have their work cut out: there are a lot of different customer groups potentially interested in what they are doing. However, a quick glance at the homepage gives me the impression that it has been carved up to satisfy the broadcast requirements of the company rather than to satisfy customers.

The homepage is heavy on links to PR releases. The financial team have managed to get seven clustered links included. Further down we have a publications and videos where the marketing and social media team get to showcase their stuff. And we have a 'traditional' top and secondary navigation and an enormous footer menu. 

Presumably that's at least three or four teams in the company that are happy-ish. They have real estate on the homepage. The most important page right? 

However, are customers happy? I wonder. Let's take the site for a test drive. I'm a student studying biochemistry. I'm interested in a career in healthcare. 

I know about the company so I google them and land on their homepage. My eyes are immediately drawn to the carousel. I try and read the content but then it disappears to be replaced by something else. Oh well. I look down the page to the left and see a list of press releases. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the titles are a bit boring. Not quite what I'm looking for anyway. 

I glance to the right. Financial stuff. I don't want that either. I look down again. I'm getting a bit fed up of all these links. I'm half tempted to watch the video. But the title isn't very appealing. 'A web series about diversity'. Has this been made for the regulators or something? Maybe I'm being too cynical. Maybe it is targeted at people like me. I don't know. 

I decide to scroll up again. Ah ha. There is a small link for 'applicants' that I missed before. I was too focused on the carousel. But I'm not an applicant. I'm just kind of interested. Gah. This is complicated. I hover over it. There's a 'get to know us' link. Right, that sounds more like it. 

I select this page and read the introductory text on this landing page. They are very keen to talk about themselves. I get the feeling they are not so focused on people like me. There's not a single 'you' in sight. I'm not sure what to do next. There's a main video but it is a grey box with a play symbol and no title. That's not very helpful.

There are 'facts and figures' about the company that I can hardly read they are so small, off to the right. There's a small video to the right that just looks like general advertising. Then I have some more choices in a menu to the left. 

I guess I should watch the video. But wait. Maybe the 'working at' the company link might be more interesting. Gosh, this is more complicated than I expected. I'm a millennial. I'm used to the web being easy. 

So, to recap:

* This site has got rather bogged down in a 'let's talk about us' mentality that can make life difficult for readers
* Internal teams, I suspect, are quite keen to have their own real estate on the website and this means customer need is not always given priority 
* With so many links on the homepage – and no real calls to action: big signposts that say to a customer 'select this perfect link for you!' – customers can get confused about what they should do next
* That sense of being led through a website in a useful and helpful way is absent – you're left to make a lot of decisions based on sometimes not very helpful information
* And we've not even talked about the browsing experience on tablets or mobiles

These two website examples should give you a better understanding of what I mean when I say that you should try and give a customer the information they need when they need it. And if you get a 'journey' approach right, then your customer will have an easy and frictionless journey through your content, meaning:

* They find the information they need
* They even find information they didn't know they needed (but that you wanted them to see)
* They feel smart and happy 
* They might even consider buying from you - happy days!


##Sell content strategy to your team (or to yourself)

Hopefully by this point you're feeling excited about the potential of content to drive growth, rather than seeing it as something tangential to your company's success. And you're beginning to realise that your content should focused on what your customers need rather than what you want to tell them.

However, you'll probably need to make a business case for investing in content strategy. Perhaps you need to get your colleagues to cooperate with you, or your CEO and investors to allocate you a budget, or you want proof that investing in content is worth it because you have limited funds and a lot of ambition!

Fair enough. Let's have a look at a few options. 

###Prepare the ground by talking to colleagues (or being honest with yourself)

Have a chat with colleagues (or yourself) about pain points in your business. It's amazing how many of these will be linked to underperforming content. Keep it quick and qualitative at this point. Just jot down pain points and see what kind of picture emerges:

* is your support team drowning in customer emails?
* does the weekly task of writing blogs make your marketing team want to cry because it seems to make no difference to business performance?
* as a CEO do you keep getting a ton of conflicting advice about content and don't know what to do?
* and so on...

This research should help you introduce content strategy to colleagues, stakeholders, freelancers and yourself without making everyone think 'oh, no, not more work!'.

### Quantify areas where content changes could make a measurable impact 

Business is largely a numbers game. It's fine to talk about the advantages of 'quality content' and a 'good user experience' but unless you can make the business case for why these matter then you're unlikely to get very far.

Investigate your customer support section and social media for signs that your content is not doing a very good job. Here are a few examples from support:

* Lots of emails asking how your product or service works
* Lots of requests that show a poor understanding of your product or service
* Lots of time-wasting queries from people who are never really going to be customers
* Lots of stressed support team members because they have way too many questions to deal with

Now let's quantify this content problem. Add up all these emails and tweets that could have been avoided with better content (either better support content or better marketing content). Estimate how much these cost in terms of the time of your support people. Bingo! You have a fairly realistic cost for having poor content. Now present the hero alternative: how improved content will reduce the cost per customer for each support person to x amount. Great. You can now use these figures to lobby for action.

Alternatively, you can measure:

* the cost of broken links 
* the cost of outdated content (particularly content that gets quite a bit of traffic)
* the cost of poor content on certain pages (landing pages that don't convert; homepages that don't send people further into the site; marketing pages where no one takes any of the actions you want)
* and more...

This approach should give you a fairly good idea of weak points in your content that are costing your company money in terms of customer abandonment or reduced team productivity.

### Identify content changes that you should make first

You might now have a very good idea of what content change you want to make to 'prove' the business case for content strategy. However, if you actually have a large list of content problems within your company then you might need to narrow them down. What should you tackle first, that will make the maximum difference to your company?

Well, you can use a key performance indicators assessment to find out. Don't worry if you don't know what KPIs are. We'll have a chat about them now. If you're already measuring yours, skip ahead to the next section.

KPIs are a way to measure the success of your business. Although your most obvious KPI might be number of products, services or subscriptions sold, you might also have other measurements that give a snapshot of the health of your business. For example, number of users, trial signups, people doing something useful on your website, newsletter signups, app downloads, churn rate, and so on.

It's a very good idea to measure your most important KPIs so you can understand how well your business is doing. Even if you are only just starting out (with a minimum viable product, for example, which only hs sufficient features to satisfy early adopters) you can still use your KPIs to spot areas of friction such as poor sales, high churn, high number of support tickets per customer, poor customer engagement with newsletters, and so on. These areas of friction point to where your content is letting you down, either because it is not suitable, not very good or missing entirely.

Ideally, you'll want to gather all your KPIs together so you can see at a glance how your business is doing. You might want to use an online dashboard platform to help you (like <a href="https://www.klipfolio.com/">Klipfolio</a>). It's tedious to have to move between different software (analytics, email, social media...) to try and get the big picture. Although you can do.

If you're still feeling shaky about KPIs then this blog post should help:

I'd also recommend reading <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">The Lean Startup</a> by Eric Ries. There's an excellent chapter on metrics. 


## Spot areas of friction with a KPI assessment

Let's look again at the fitness tech startup, whose core content strategy statement we saw earlier. They are lucky enough to have a head of content who wants to do a great job. She's going to do a KPI assessment to see how best she what content problems are causing her company the most grief.

First off, she tracks their KPIs:

-   no of new visitors to the website
-   no. of people who signed up for a free trial
-   no. of people who used the product during the trial period
-   no. of people who signed up to a paid plan
-   average lifetime of customers
-   churn rate

They got 4,000 new users to their website last month, according to Google Analytics. It was 3,500 the month before that. Not bad.

They convert around 7% to a free trial. However, this isn't the same as people actually getting out their credit card. And this is where the picture looks less rosy. Only 0.8% of people on a free trial sign up to a paid plan. This isn't good.

Their content strategist looks at another KPI that might help explain the poor conversion rate between the free trail and paid plans: the number of people who found value in the product, that is, actually tried it out. It turns out that only 2% of the free trial people actually used the software during the trial period. This really isn't good. Perhaps people simply don't like the product? 

However, thankfully, this doesn't seem likely: the average lifetime of the customers they do manage to convert is respectable: 9 months last month and 9.3 months this month. This KPI is heading in the right direction. Their churn rate (the amount of customers or subscribers who leave during a given time period) is also hovering around 5%. Not bad.

So, their content lead is fairly pleased with the number of new visitors to the website and with the conversion rate to the free trial. She also can’t complain about the average lifetime of their customers and their churn rate. It’s early days, but these are looking okay. However, their ability to get people to move from a free plan to a paid plan is quite frankly rubbish. She's worried, and asks herself:

-   If customers like our product, why are only a few paying for it?
-   Why are they not trying out the software during the trial period?

These are the answers she comes up with:

-   Not sure. Pricing?
-   Hum, perhaps they don’t make this easy enough.

She's going to leave pricing for now because she just doesn't think that's the
problem. So she digs deeper and starts seeing that their onboarding process (how you help people to get oriented and engaged with your product or service) is
not doing its job properly. 

Customers seem confused about how to set up the software and get value from the product to start with. She discovers that their support team have flagged this up as a problem for months. She makes a note to talk to the support team more often.

So, she now know what she needs to do to try and get more customers to
convert to a paid trial: rethink the startup's onboarding content so customers
find it easy to see value in the software. Onboarding content can involve a series of emails, dashboard content when they first access the software, even a phone conversation. 

Rather than implementing the new user onboarding for all customers straight away though, she is going to a/b test. So 50% of new customers get the new content and 50% get the old. That way she can prove to the company stakeholders (and to herself) that it is the content rethink that has resulted in a higher conversion rate of free trials to paid accounts rather than anything else. That will also make it easier for her to lobby for more content strategy in the face of competing internal suggestions like:

1. let's create a new product feature to improve conversion suggests the tech lead

2. Let's invest in a new sales campaign suggests the sales lead

3. Let's launch a blog suggests the CEO, because everyone else has one.

Or not. Let's invest in more content strategy. Then we can see what the business case is for the other suggestions because we've already made ours!
