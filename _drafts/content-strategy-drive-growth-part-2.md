excerpt: Many solopreneurs, startups and growing businesses overlook the importance of content, because they are focused on other matters. However, this leads ot lost sales and increased costs. In this chapter I’ll give you an overview of how you can make sure you have content that drives growth and increases productivity, as well as how you can make the business case for content strategy.

##Sell content strategy to your team (or to yourself)

In this article we'll look at how you can prove the value of content strategy to yourself, to your colleagues and to your stakeholders.

So, hopefully you're feeling excited about the potential of content to drive growth, rather than seeing it as something tangential to your company's success. And you're beginning to realise that your content should focused on what your customers need rather than what you want to tell them.

If you're not at this point yet, have a read of my previous article: We want to grow faster and think good content will help.

However, even if you're excited about content strategy you'll probably need to make a business case for investing in it. Perhaps you need to get your colleagues to cooperate with you, or your CEO and investors to allocate you a budget, or you want proof that investing in content is worth it because you have limited funds and a lot of ambition!

Fair enough. Let's have a look at a few options. 

###Prepare the ground by talking to colleagues (or being honest with yourself)

Have a chat with colleagues (or yourself) about pain points in your business. It's amazing how many of these will be linked to underperforming content. Keep it quick and qualitative at this point. Just jot down pain points and see what kind of picture emerges:

* is your support team drowning in customer emails?
* does the weekly task of writing blogs make your marketing team want to cry because it seems to make no difference to business performance?
* as a CEO do you keep getting a ton of conflicting advice about content and don't know what to do?
* and so on...

This research should help you introduce content strategy to colleagues, stakeholders, freelancers and yourself without making everyone think 'oh, no, not more work!'.

### Quantify areas where content changes could make a measurable impact 

Business is largely a numbers game. It's fine to talk about the advantages of 'quality content' and a 'good user experience' but unless you can make the business case for why these matter then you're unlikely to get very far.

Investigate your customer support section and social media for signs that your content is not doing a very good job. Here are a few examples from support:

* Lots of emails asking how your product or service works
* Lots of requests that show a poor understanding of your product or service
* Lots of time-wasting queries from people who are never really going to be customers
* Lots of stressed support team members because they have way too many questions to deal with

Now let's quantify this content problem. Add up all these emails and tweets that could have been avoided with better content (either better support content or better marketing content). Estimate how much these cost in terms of the time of your support people. Bingo! You have a fairly realistic cost for having poor content. Now present the hero alternative: how improved content will reduce the cost per customer for each support person to x amount. Great. You can now use these figures to lobby for action.

Alternatively, you can measure:

* the cost of broken links 
* the cost of outdated content (particularly content that gets quite a bit of traffic)
* the cost of poor content on certain pages (landing pages that don't convert; homepages that don't send people further into the site; marketing pages where no one takes any of the actions you want)
* and more...

This approach should give you a fairly good idea of weak points in your content that are costing your company money in terms of customer abandonment or reduced team productivity.

### Identify content changes that you should make first

You might now have a very good idea of what content change you want to make to 'prove' the business case for content strategy. However, if you actually have a large list of content problems within your company then you might need to narrow them down. What should you tackle first, that will make the maximum difference to your company?

Well, you can use a key performance indicators assessment to find out. Don't worry if you don't know what KPIs are. We'll have a chat about them now. If you're already measuring yours, skip ahead to the next section.

KPIs are a way to measure the success of your business. Although your most obvious KPI might be number of products, services or subscriptions sold, you might also have other measurements that give a snapshot of the health of your business. For example, number of users, trial signups, people doing something useful on your website, newsletter signups, app downloads, churn rate, and so on.

It's a very good idea to measure your most important KPIs so you can understand how well your business is doing. Even if you are only just starting out (with a minimum viable product, for example, which only hs sufficient features to satisfy early adopters) you can still use your KPIs to spot areas of friction such as poor sales, high churn, high number of support tickets per customer, poor customer engagement with newsletters, and so on. These areas of friction point to where your content is letting you down, either because it is not suitable, not very good or missing entirely.

Ideally, you'll want to gather all your KPIs together so you can see at a glance how your business is doing. You might want to use an online dashboard platform to help you (like <a href="https://www.klipfolio.com/">Klipfolio</a>). It's tedious to have to move between different software (analytics, email, social media...) to try and get the big picture. Although you can do.

If you're still feeling shaky about KPIs then this blog post should help:

I'd also recommend reading <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">The Lean Startup</a> by Eric Ries. There's an excellent chapter on metrics. 


## Spot areas of friction with a KPI assessment

Let's look again at the fitness tech startup, whose core content strategy statement we saw earlier. They are lucky enough to have a head of content who wants to do a great job. She's going to do a KPI assessment to see how best she what content problems are causing her company the most grief.

First off, she tracks their KPIs:

-   no of new visitors to the website
-   no. of people who signed up for a free trial
-   no. of people who used the product during the trial period
-   no. of people who signed up to a paid plan
-   average lifetime of customers
-   churn rate

They got 4,000 new users to their website last month, according to Google Analytics. It was 3,500 the month before that. Not bad.

They convert around 7% to a free trial. However, this isn't the same as people actually getting out their credit card. And this is where the picture looks less rosy. Only 0.8% of people on a free trial sign up to a paid plan. This isn't good.

Their content strategist looks at another KPI that might help explain the poor conversion rate between the free trail and paid plans: the number of people who found value in the product, that is, actually tried it out. It turns out that only 2% of the free trial people actually used the software during the trial period. This really isn't good. Perhaps people simply don't like the product? 

However, thankfully, this doesn't seem likely: the average lifetime of the customers they do manage to convert is respectable: 9 months last month and 9.3 months this month. This KPI is heading in the right direction. Their churn rate (the amount of customers or subscribers who leave during a given time period) is also hovering around 5%. Not bad.

So, their content lead is fairly pleased with the number of new visitors to the website and with the conversion rate to the free trial. She also can’t complain about the average lifetime of their customers and their churn rate. It’s early days, but these are looking okay. However, their ability to get people to move from a free plan to a paid plan is quite frankly rubbish. She's worried, and asks herself:

-   If customers like our product, why are only a few paying for it?
-   Why are they not trying out the software during the trial period?

These are the answers she comes up with:

-   Not sure. Pricing?
-   Hum, perhaps they don’t make this easy enough.

She's going to leave pricing for now because she just doesn't think that's the
problem. So she digs deeper and starts seeing that their onboarding process (how you help people to get oriented and engaged with your product or service) is
not doing its job properly. 

Customers seem confused about how to set up the software and get value from the product to start with. She discovers that their support team have flagged this up as a problem for months. She makes a note to talk to the support team more often.

So, she now know what she needs to do to try and get more customers to
convert to a paid trial: rethink the startup's onboarding content so customers
find it easy to see value in the software. Onboarding content can involve a series of emails, dashboard content when they first access the software, even a phone conversation. 

Rather than implementing the new user onboarding for all customers straight away though, she is going to a/b test. So 50% of new customers get the new content and 50% get the old. That way she can prove to the company stakeholders (and to herself) that it is the content rethink that has resulted in a higher conversion rate of free trials to paid accounts rather than anything else. That will also make it easier for her to lobby for more content strategy in the face of competing internal suggestions like:

1. let's create a new product feature to improve conversion suggests the tech lead

2. Let's invest in a new sales campaign suggests the sales lead

3. Let's launch a blog suggests the CEO, because everyone else has one.

Or not. Let's invest in more content strategy. Then we can see what the business case is for the other suggestions because we've already made ours!
