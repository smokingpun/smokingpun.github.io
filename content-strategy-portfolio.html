            <p>SendOwl is an independent ecommerce platform for digital products. I've produced various content strategy deliverables such as our message architecture, user personas and various content templates to ensure that SendOwl are consistently producing compelling, branded content.

            <h4>Xoomworks – tech company</h4> 
            <p>Xoomworks in an Artios client who we helped with a major website redesign. A technology company with a fantastic client list, they specialises in procurement, business intelligence and technology outsourcing. Pivoting from their original model of one website, we helped them develop a major web presence encompassing three microsites.</p> 

            <p>The challenge was to ensure consistency across the microsites while still communicating the key messages of each specialism. By approaching this project content-first, we were able to concentrate on developing an online presence that specifically targeted the needs of Xoomworks' clients.

            <p>Bcalm is an Artios client that we helped build an online presence for the launch of their new product, an innovative medical device that quickly provides relief for people during panic attacks.</p> 

            <p>The challenge was to ensure that we developed a brand that appeals to people in an emotionally-charged condition, something which is often done very badly (as anyone who has browsed panic-related sites will know!). Early-stage user research was critical in helping us build a brand that was calming, safe, accessible, and scientific.

            <p>I helped with user research and interpretation of the metrics. I also wireframed key pages (for different viewports), including two new landing page, as well as edited existing copy and created new copy where necessary. I've blogged about my content strategy work on Vimcasts.
