          <h2>Content strategy for solopreneurs, startups and growing businesses</h2>  
          <h4>Why your content matters – probably more than you think</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Effectively targeted content will get customers interested in your product and guide them towards a buying decision</li>
            <li>Interesting and relevant content keeps them engaged with your product even after they’ve made their first purchase</li>
            <li>Useful and easy to understand content reduces the cost of servicing that customer</li>
            <li>Content strategy will help you scale without lapsing into a 'feed the content beast' mentality, which offers a poor return on investment and can decimate team morale</li>
          </ul> 
          <p><strong>However, many solopreneurs, startups and growing businesses overlook the importance of content, because they are focused on other matters. And this leads to lost sales, increased costs and general frustration.</strong> Don't let that happen to you!</p>

            <h4>No – it's much more than that!</h4>

            <p>Your content certainly includes copywriting and media assets like images, video and audio on your main site or app. However it also includes microcopy, a company intranet or wiki, an external help section, emails and newsletters, social media, print brochures and any other asset that help customers understand what you do and why they should care.</p>

            <h4>Content strategy as the linchpin</h4> 

              <p>If you are strategically approaching content then you will inevitably find yourself thinking about the design of your site, the information architecture, the user experience, the efficiency of your processes, and much more. Content strategy is the linchpin that holds all these practises together.</p>
