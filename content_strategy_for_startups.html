          <h2>Content strategy for your startup or growing business</h2>  
          <h4>Why your content matters – probably more than you think!</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Effectively targeted content will get customers interested in your product</li>
            <li>Persuasive and helpful content guides them towards a buying decision</li>
            <li>Interesting and relevant content keeps them engaged with your product even after they’ve made their first purchase</li>
            <li>Useful and easy to understand content reduces the cost of servicing that customer</li>
          </ul> 
          <p><strong>However, many startups and growing businesses overlook the importance of content, because they are focused on other matters. And this hits their bottom line.</strong> Don't let that happen to you!</p>
