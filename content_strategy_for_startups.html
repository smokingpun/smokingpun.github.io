            <p>Your content certainly includes copywriting and media assets like images, video and audio on your main site or app. However it also includes microcopy, a company intranet or wiki, an external help section, emails and newsletters, social media, print brochures and any other asset that help customers understand what you do and why they should care.</p>

              <p>If you are strategically approaching content then you will inevitably find yourself thinking about the design of your site, the information architecture, the user experience, the efficiency of your processes, and much more. Content strategy is the linchpin that holds all these practises together.</p>
