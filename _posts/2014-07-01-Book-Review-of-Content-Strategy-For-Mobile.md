In A Book Apart’s Content Strategy for Mobile (2012), Karen McGrane discusses why and how to get your content ready for different devices, platforms, screen sizes, and resolutions. She argues for making our content adaptive to mobile, and for content parity across different devices and experiences, because we can’t know what a user wants by screen size alone. This book is a great read if you need clarity on why you should make your content mobile-friendly, or if you need tips about how to do it. For those that like dissembling things to see how they work, you’ll need more than this book alone.
