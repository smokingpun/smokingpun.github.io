I've been working with Drew Neil to develop a content strategy for the popular developers' site, Vimcasts. I've already blogged about how we used the user survey to canvass people's opionions and Google anayltics to analyse behaviour. Now it's time to make Vimcasts' content work harder. We'll start with the homepage. 

###Goal: Increase people's engagement with the site
Our research has suggested that although Vimcasts has a committed fan base, there are a lot of people – almost a quarter of a million in a year – who are spending only a short amount of time on the site. People who completed the user survey also pointed out that Vimcasts could be more user-friendly in terms of having some kind of search or categories functionality. Putting these two points together - and a few others – we decided that one of the goals of the redesign is to increase people's engagement with the site by making the content easier to navigate on all devices.

####Add tags/categories and search
Drew has added tags to all articles and screencasts. This means that people can now search Vimcasts by category: This option is intended for people who land on the site and think: 'I'm interested in Vim plugins or 'I'd like to know more about registers: what is there?'. <strong>We've also included information about how many screencasts and articles there are on the site</strong> – and this will be automatically updated – to give new visitors an idea of the breadth of the site.

<strong>Drew had also added site-wide search so that people who land on the site and know what they are looking for can get that information – fast</strong>. This option is intended for people who land on the site and say: 'What's vspec?' or 'I like the sound of the Arglist for project-wide find and replace. I want to find out more! 'We might get rid of the search box that's currently to the right of the navigation. 

####Differentiate between articles and screencasts
Sometimes you really feel like reading an article; sometimes you'd rather watch a screencasts. And if you don't easily have the choice? Maybe you'll just... go to another site instead. Fair enough. So we decided to differentiate between the two. As you can see below, homepage visitors now have the option of browsing the latest screencast or article. <strong>We've also included useful metadata, including the runtime of screencasts, so people can easily see if they have enough time/bandwidth</strong>. 

Here's a screenshot of the top half of the redesigned homepage on a desktop. On smaller screens 'search the archives' drops underneath the 'find by category' section.

###Goal: Give more visibility to training, publications and pro-screencasts
Drew offers online workshops about once a month, in-person workshops occasionally within Europe and private workshops for companies. He also has a book for sale, [Practical Vim][] (Pragmatic Bookshelf), and has produced [professional screencasts for Thoughtbot][thoughtbot]. He plans to produce more training courses and publications.
