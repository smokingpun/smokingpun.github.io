Over the last ten years Iâ€™ve worked as a writer, editor, proofreader, researcher and project manager. It's been great: I love working with content. However, I've often worked at the edge of companies, bringing content to the party just as its ending. And in my opinion content doesn't really belong there. It should be the centre of things, a bottle of gin in one hand and someone else's hand in the other. So, when I discovered content strategy in 2013, I was hooked. This was how content should be approached: strategically, creatively, and with real passion.
