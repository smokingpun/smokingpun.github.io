title:  "What Makes a Good Content Strategist? My Attempts to Level Up"
date:   2013-12-04 
categories: blog
excerpt: One thing I really like about content strategy is that 'imposter syndrome' still isn't a big deal. Yes, there are some established names in the field, but not many. True, there are some good books, but not a whole bookshelf of them. People are coming into the discipline all the time from various backgrounds. People are also 'doing' content strategy all the time without realising it or at least being thanked for it.

One thing I really like about content strategy is that 'imposter syndrome' still isn't a big deal. Yes, there are some established names in the field, but not many. True, there are some good books, but not a whole bookshelf of them. People are coming into the discipline all the time from various backgrounds.

<h3>What skills does a content strategist need?</h3>
<p>
However, as with any discipline, there are some skills that are more important than others. I figured that a content strategist should probably have a passing familiarity with copywriting, editing, social media, management, UX and so on. So far, so good. However, what I realised I didn't have – and probably should – was more of an understanding of what developers and designers were up to. The problem was I'd been spoilt: I've known some great developers and designers who totally get content. But this scenario was probably not one that would always be true, and in any case, I shouldn't be so lazy. Or at least lazily accepting of cultural stereotypes that equate coding with guys.

<h3>Why coding is a bit like proofreading</h3>
<p>
Bearing this in mind, I went back to school the modern way: by doing some online courses. The first course I tried was run by Nettuts and was called <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css-a-free-tuts-premium-course/">'30 Days to Learn HTML and CSS'</a>. It did was it said on the tin. By day 30 I has some idea of what was going on, even if floats still tended to make my head hurt. However, having just finished proofreading a 500-page ms with 200 pages of notes and references I was surprised at how doable coding was in comparison. Proofreading requires an eye for detail and an ability to learn and implement different patterns (a Chicago-style first citation of a book in the notes section requires a different format to a second mention and a definitely a different format to a book chapter… you get the picture). Coding wasn't easy in comparison: but neither was it mind-bendingly hard, as I'd somehow thought it must be seeing as developers get paid about four times as much as proofreaders! So, I had a go at building a site. It looked awful, but was still a website of sorts. Huzzah!

<h3>Learning CSS</h3>
<p>
After that I started a CSS <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/css-cross-country">'cross-country' course</a> by Code School. They use gaming to encourage you to work harder: it kind of worked. I liked to see myself making measurable progress up that mountain. I began to feel like I was beginning to get somewhere. I wasn't exactly going to end up as a pro, but I could at least understand what front and back end developers might be up against, some of the time. I also thought that I maybe knew enough to build my content strategy website. And if I didn't, I lived with a developer who did (note to self: don't be lazy!). 
</p>
<h3>Designing my website</h3>
<p>
This time, I got my head around the design side a bit more. I like design so this ended up being quite exciting. I chose a colour pallet courtesy of <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/">COLOURlovers</a> and a font courtesy of <a href="https://typekit.com">Typekit</a>. I saw a narrative pathway design on <a href="https://learn.thoughtbot.com/prime">Thoughbot Prime</a> and thought that would really work. I looked at their code and after a moment of panic realised I did understand most of it. I traced the pathway to <a href="http://jsplumbtoolkit.com/demo/home/jquery.html">JS PLumb</a>. I then started coding and realised that the z-index and clearfix hack are actually quite useful. Here's my preliminary sketch for this website. You can also see my code on <a href="https://github.com/smokingpun/smokingpun.github.io">github</a>.

<h3>What learning to code has taught me about content strategy so far</h3>
<p>
As well as learning about HTML and CSS I've also, perhaps unsurprisingly, learnt quite a lot about content strategy. I've learnt that it really is important to 'chunk' content so your website can potentially work on different devices. 'Chunking' is also good so you can reuse content – or someone else can. I also learnt that content should be user-friendly not just in terms of what it says, but how it looks. Too much text, no matter how well-written, can be confusing for a user. Navigation is a content issue; what buttons say is important. I could go on. I probably will in another blog post.
