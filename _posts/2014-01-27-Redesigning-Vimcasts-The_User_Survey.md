title:  "Redesigning Vimcasts: The User Survey"

excerpt: I've been working with Drew Neil to redesign the popular developers' site, Vimcasts. I've had a few thoughts about what might make the site more user-friendly and more supportive of Drew's current business goals. However, there's nothing quite like asking your users to find out what your content does well – and what it doesn't. Read on to find out what Vimcast users said about the site.

[*drew: You should avoid using the word 'users'. They are people! Suggested alternatives: Visitors. Readers. Viewers. Subscribers. Fans.*]

<p>There's nothing quite like asking your users to find out what your business does well – and what it doesn't. This blog post is based on the reponses from 216 users. We asked users five questions. <p/>

<ol>
	<li>how did you first learn about Vimcasts.org? (6 options)</li>
	<li>how do you prefer to receive updates? (6 options)</li>
	<li>Can you suggest any changes that would make it easier to find what you're looking for on Vimcasts.org?</li>
	<li>I support my work on Vimcasts by teaching a Core Vim class. You: have attended, would like to attend, can't afford it, are not interested, have never heard about it, other.</li>
	<li>Where are you based?</li>
</ol>	

<h3>Users are based all over the world</h3>
<p>Question 5, where are you based, turned out to be pretty exciting: <b>users were based in more than 25 different countries</b> ranging from the UK and USA to Argentina, Lithuania, Taiwan, Russia and China. However, only 3 users suggested that subtitles or access to transcriptions would be useful. Impressive language skills!</p> 

<p>Still, Drew has been thinking about making screencast transcripts available on the site and on Github, particuarly in case users would like to translate any. With people from all over the world browsing Vimcasts this might prove useful.</p>

<h3>Users have the kind of memory that my grandad would be embarrassed about</h3>

<p>My favourite answer to question 1, 'how did you first learn about Vimcasts.org,' is: <i>can't remember, that was, like, 4 years ago</i>. This was ticked by 36% of users. The other results, however, were a little more informative:</p>

<p><b>These results suggest that <abbrev title="search-engine optimisation">SEO</abbrev> is important, as is continuing to produce content that people want to share and talk about</b>. Sites that talk about Vimcasts range from Reddit (Drew occasionally posts his content there, and sometimes other Reddit users do too) to net.tutsplus, a wiki [*drew: "a wiki" is a bit vague. Which one?*] and personal blogs. I was slightly surprised that only 7% of users found out about the site through social media. The Vimcasts Twitter account has almost 3,500 followers. Perhaps users tend to follow Vimcasts when they already know about it though? So this channel represents a great way to target repeat rather than first time users.</p> 

<h3>Repeat users may never visit the website</h3>

<p>A business's website is only part of their content strategy, particularly with this kind of content-as-product business. <b>There are some users who will rarely come back to the site, but who are still important customers</b>. The user survey shows that only 4% of users would prefer not to subscribe.</p>

<p>One result of these findings, is that Drew needs to think carefully about how he chunks the content on the website. There is a good case, for example, for more obviously separating promotional blog posts, content blog posts and screencasts on the homepage. This was picked up on in the survey by a few users. However, if Drew decides that only content blog posts would be permanently linked to from the homepage, then he'd still have to make sure than RSS users received both promotional and content blog posts, as well as screencasts.</p>

<h3>Users know about the Masterclasses</h3>

<p>Quite cheeringly, <b>only 1% of users had never heard of Drew's masterclasses</b>. This suggests that although the permanent link on the homepage is not exactly obvious, Twitter, email and RSS time-sensitive promotions are being fairly effective. Also cheeringly, 25% of users would like to attend. The 34% who can't afford it was probably about right, considering Drew's business model. However, it was a useful number for Drew to see because he's considering producing a series of inexpensive eBooks.</p>

<h3>Vimcasts users are a nice bunch</h3>

<p>Seriously, 10 users decided to tell Drew how much they liked Vimcasts in the space we'd left for suggestions (question 3). One user even wanted to have his babies. Although that is a bit weird, come to think of it. The user was male.</p>

<h3>More categories/tags and a search function</h3>
<p>This table shows what users would like Drew to change about Vimcasts:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>add categories/tags</th>
			<td>23</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>add search</th>
			<td>11</td>
		</tr>		
		<tr>	
			<th>more Vimcasts!</th>
			<td>4</td>
		</tr>	
		<tr>	
			<th>include subtitles/transcriptions</th>
			<td>3</td>
		</tr>	
		<tr>	
			<th>separate posts and screencasts</th>
			<td>2</td>
		</tr>	
		<tr>	
			<th>Vimcasts is great/no changes thanks</th>
			<td>13</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>	

<p>Great! <b>We think tags/categories and a search function would be a nifty idea too</b>. I was also interested to see how many people think Vimcasts is just fine or that there wasn't anything obvious that needed changing. This made me realise how important it is not to be too iconoclastic. After all, there's many a redesign that has seemed like a good idea to the bods at the top but has gone down like a lead balloon with users (the rebranding of Britain's Royal Mail as 'Consignia' springs to mind [drew: link?]).</p>

<h3>Concluding thoughts</h3>
<p><b>Asking users what they think of your business is a very good idea</b>. I've learnt a lot. Onwards!</p>
