metadescription: Read how I helped Vimcast founder Drew Neil optimise the site's homepage.
excerpt: I've been working with Drew Neil to develop a content strategy for the popular developers' site, Vimcasts. I've already blogged about how the user survey helped us to canvass people's opinions and how Google anayltics helped us analyse people's behaviour. Now it's time to make Vimcasts' content work harder. We'll start with the homepage.</p>

<p>I've been working with Drew Neil to develop a content strategy for the popular developers' site, Vimcasts. I've already blogged about how the user survey helped us to canvass people's opinions and how Google anayltics helped us analyse people's behaviour. Now it's time to make Vimcasts' content work harder. We'll start with the homepage. </p>
<h3 id="goal-increase-peoples-engagement-with-the-site">Goal: Increase people's engagement with the site</h3>
<p>Our research has suggested that although Vimcasts has a committed fan base, there are a lot of people – almost a quarter of a million in a year – who are spending only a short amount of time on the site. People who completed the user survey also pointed out that Vimcasts could be more user-friendly in terms of having some kind of search or categories functionality. </p>
<h4 id="what-we-did-added-tagscategories-and-search">What we did: added tags/categories and search</h4>
<p>People can now search Vimcasts by category. This option should help people who land on the site and think: 'I'm interested in Vim plugins or 'I'd like to know more about registers: what is there?'. <strong>In addition, we've included information about how many screencasts and articles there are on the site</strong> – and this will be automatically updated – to give new visitors an idea of the breadth of the site.</p>
<p><strong>We've also added site-wide search so that people who land on the site and know what they are looking for can get that information – fast</strong>. This option should help people who land on the site and say: 'What's vspec?' or 'I like the sound of the Arglist for project-wide find and replace. I want to find out more!' </p>
<p>Using a content-first approach, we came up with this first iteration of the homepage:</p>
<p><img class = "Vimcasts_redesign_desktop" src="/images/Vimcasts_redesign_desktop.png" alt="a screenshot of the redesigned Vimcasts homepage on a desktop"></p>
<h4 id="what-we-did-differentiated-between-articles-and-screencasts">What we did: differentiated between articles and screencasts</h4>
<p>Sometimes you really feel like reading an article; sometimes you'd rather watch a screencasts. And if you don't easily have the choice? Maybe you'll just... go to another site instead. Fair enough. So we decided to differentiate between the two. As you can see above, homepage visitors now have the option of browsing the latest screencast or article. <strong>We've also included useful metadata, including the runtime of screencasts, so people can easily see if they have enough time/bandwidth</strong>. </p>
<p>Given that Vimcasts is currently underperforming on mobile devices, we also wanted to make sure the redesigned site works well cross-channel. Here's a screenshot of the search and category features on a mobile:</p>
<p><img class = "Vimcasts_redesign_homepage_mobile_short_version" src="/images/Vimcasts_redesign_homepage_mobile_short_version.png" alt="a screenshot of the redesigned Vimcasts homepage on a desktop"></p>
<h3 id="goal-give-more-visibility-to-training-publications-and-pro-screencasts">Goal: Give more visibility to training, publications and pro-screencasts</h3>
<p>Our research suggested that although regular fans mainly knew about Drew's professional work, new or less engaged visitors (who didn't subscibe by RSS or follow Drew on Twitter) weren't so well informed. </p>
<h4 id="what-we-did-added-calls-to-action-on-the-homepage">What we did: added calls to action on the homepage</h4>
<p>We will also add images/icons for each of the three sections to draw the eye to these content chunks. </p>
<h4 id="what-we-did-added-a-banner-that-is-automatically-updated">What we did: added a banner that is automatically updated</h4>
<p>As you'll see above, this banner advertises one of Drew's training courses. This banner will automatically update to feature Drew's latest class. </p>
<p><strong>Across the site we've used content modules to show time-sensitive information that is then automatically updated</strong>. This is great because Drew can let people know what he's up to without needing to write more content. It also means he's less likely to have out of date and irrelevant content on the site. </p>
<h3 id="whats-next">What's next?</h3>
<p>I'll be blogging soon about the new categories page and the content template for articles and screencasts. Keep in touch through RSS or by following me on Twitter. </p></body></html>
