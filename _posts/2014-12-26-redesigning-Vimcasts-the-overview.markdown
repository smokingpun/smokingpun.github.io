excerpt: I was asked by Drew Neil, founder of Vimcasts, to help redesign the site. When Drew set up Vimcasts in January 2010 he envisaged making perhaps 12 screencasts about the text editor Vim, in his spare time. The site currently hosts more than 60 free screencasts and 20 blog posts. Drew now makes a living from training people how to use Vim. Read on to see what we've been up to.

[Vimcasts][Vimcasts_homepage] publishes free screencasts about Vim, the text editor. It was set up by Drew Neil in January 2010 and has had more than half a million unique visitors. When Drew set up the site he envisaged making perhaps 12 screencasts, in his spare time. The site currently hosts more than 60 free screencasts and 20 blog posts. Drew makes a living from training people how to use Vim. 

###Why Vimcasts is great

Vimcasts has a loyal following of developers and is doing a great job of helping people learn Vim. How do I know? Because users are pretty complimentary:

>I wrote the PeepCode screencasts on Vim. I watch your screencasts because I invariably learn something each time. Andy Stewart
>
These screen casts are great! I’ve been using Vi/vim for over 20 years and learned something new. Derek McLoughlin 
>
Vimcasts.org is the single best screencast I’ve seen in the past two years. They’re very well put together, and cleanly edited. David Brady, on the Ruby Rogues podcast

The bottom line is clear: users like the screencasts. Excellent! Useful, informative content is what will make users come back to your site and tell their friends and colleagues about your site. 

###What Vimcasts looks like at the moment

If you take a look at the Vimcasts site you'll see that the logo is top left, the main menu top right, and that the main content is organised using a blog layout, so only the latest blogs and screencasts appear on the homepage. If you want to find older content, you can go to the 'all episodes' link which takes you to a list organised chronologically. Or you do a google search. If you want to find out about Drew you go to the 'about us' link – although there is no mention of Drew's book or his Vim masterclasses. To find out about the latter then the only permanent link is at the bottom of the page. To find out about Drew's book you can click on a picture of the book cover, also on the homepage. The site isn't responsive. <img class = "Vimcasts_screenshot" src="/images/Vimcasts_screenshot.png" alt="a screenshot of the Vimcasts homepage">

Drew promotes his screencasts mainly through social media and RSS: Vimcasts has nearly 3,500 followers and, Drew estimates, 10,000 subscribers. This means that some users will be funneled straight to certain episodes and blog posts. Others will never, or rarely, visit the site.  

###Initial contenty strategy thoughts

My first thought was that the web content needs to be easier to navigate. At the moment there is no search function. Episodes are arranged chronologically rather than themetically. Blog posts, including both useful information about Vim and product promotion, as well as screencasts, share the same space on the news feed.

My second thought was that the website could better support Drew's current business model. When he started Vimcasts he worked for someone else: now he makes a living training people to use Vim. In short, I thought that the main content was great but could work harder. This was all informed guesswork though. My next step was to ask users what they think about the site.
