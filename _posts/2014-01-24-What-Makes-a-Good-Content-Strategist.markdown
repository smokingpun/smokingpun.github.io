<h3>What skills does a content strategist need?</h3>
<p>
As with any discipline, there are some skills that are more important than others. However, I figured that a content strategist should probably have a passing familiarity with copywriting, editing, social media, management, UX and so on. So far, so good. However, <b>what I realised I didn't have – and probably should – was more of an understanding of what developers and designers were up to</b>. The problem was I'd been spoilt: I've known some great developers and designers who totally get content. But this scenario was probably not one that would always be true and, in any case, I shouldn't be so lazy. Or at least lazily accepting of cultural stereotypes that equate coding with guys.

<h3>Why coding is a bit like proofreading</h3>
<p>
Bearing this in mind, I went back to school the modern way: by doing some online courses. The first course I tried was run by Nettuts and was called <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/30-days-to-learn-html-and-css-a-free-tuts-premium-course/">'30 Days to Learn HTML and CSS'</a>. It did what it said on the tin. By day 30 I has some idea of what was going on, even if floats still tended to make my head hurt. However, having just finished proofreading a 500-page ms with 200 pages of notes and references I was surprised at how doable coding was in comparison. Proofreading requires an eye for detail and an ability to learn and implement different patterns (a Chicago-style first citation of a book in the notes section requires a different format to a second mention and a definitely a different format to a book chapter… you get the picture). Coding wasn't easy in comparison: but neither was it mind-bendingly hard, as I'd somehow thought it must be seeing as developers get paid about four times as much as proofreaders! So, I had a go at building a site. It looked awful, but was still a website of sorts. Huzzah!

<h3>Learning CSS</h3>
<p>
After that I started a CSS <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/css-cross-country">'cross-country' course</a> by Code School. They use gaming to encourage you to work harder: it kind of worked. I liked to see myself making measurable progress up that mountain. I began to feel like I was beginning to get somewhere. I wasn't exactly going to end up as a pro, but I could at least understand what front and back end developers might be up against, some of the time. I also thought that I maybe knew enough to build my content strategy website. And if I didn't, I lived with a developer who did (note to self: don't be lazy!).

<h3>Designing my website</h3>
<p>
This time, I got my head around the design side a bit more. I like design so this ended up being quite exciting. I chose a colour pallet courtesy of <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/">COLOURlovers</a> and a font courtesy of <a href="https://typekit.com">Typekit</a>. I saw a narrative pathway design on <a href="https://learn.thoughtbot.com/prime">Thoughbot Prime</a> and thought that would really work. I looked at their code and after a moment of panic realised I did understand most of it. I traced the pathway to <a href="http://jsplumbtoolkit.com/demo/home/jquery.html">JS PLumb</a>. I then started coding and realised that the z-index and clearfix hack are actually quite useful. Here's my preliminary sketch for this website. You can also see my code on <a href="https://github.com/smokingpun/smokingpun.github.io">github</a>.

<h3>How to stop feeling like a hopeless beginner</h3>
<p>
Even though I'd made some progress I still felt like a hopeless beginner. Luckily, I'd heard about an organisation called <a href="http://codebar.io/">Codebar</a> that runs free programming sessions. Their aim is to make tech "more diverse and welcoming by bringing people together and helping teach programming skills." I went along on a Wednesday evening and found myself surrounded by motivated, interesting people who wanted to learn to code. Some of them were making headway on Javascript; some knew less about CSS and HTML than I did: amazing! The coaches were great: encouraging without being patronising (which is quiet a skill). So, thanks Codebar people. I'm still a beginner, but not such a hopeless one.
