        <p>You're probably here because you've heard people talking about content strategy. It sounds like a great idea. After all, it’s hard keeping your content under control. If someone asks about your content strategy you might say “what strategy?” Your content is expanding so quickly that it's hard to keep track of what’s being published every week, let alone editing or archiving old content. It doesn’t have to be this way though. My name is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahadcock">Hannah Adcock Neil</a> and I can help you curate your content so that it's user-focused, meaningful and future-friendly. By doing so, you'll save time because you'll only produce content that is necessary. You'll make money because curated content will turn site visitors into customers. Here's what I can do:</p>

        <figure id="bullet-1" class="journey-bullet _jsPlumb_endpoint_anchor_">1.</figure>
        <h2>Analysis and Auditing</h2>
        <p>You'll tell me what your key business objectives are. I'll analyse your content – your website, social media and any publications – to see whether it's supporting these objectives and is user-friendly. I'll also do a content audit of your existing web material – or part of it at least. A content audit usually involves listing what content is on your site, where it is located and whether it is doing a good job.</p>

        <figure id="bullet-2" class="journey-bullet _jsPlumb_endpoint_anchor_">2.</figure>
        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>This is where I use Google Analytics, KISSmetrics, Crazy Egg, Topsy – basically, whatever's most relevant and fits your budget – to see what your users are doing. Are they making it through your sales funnel? Is your 'buy now' button in a place that only 10% of yoru users ever venture?  I'll then have a think about why your users are behaving as they are. A simple example is that you might have a high landing page bounce rate because 45% of your users access your site from a mobile device and your site isn't responsive. We could also do some user-testing at this point. What do your users think of your site? Is it easy to use? What could be better?</p>

        <figure id="bullet-3" class="journey-bullet _jsPlumb_endpoint_anchor_">3.</figure>
        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>I'll go over the results of my data crunching and analysis with you. I'll refer to a written report or make a powerpoint presentation if you prefer. Then we'll sit down over a cup of tea and develop a plan of action. I'll bring some suggestions to the table – and maybe some cake. You will too. Your content strategy has to be sustainable over the longer-term, which means working out who on your team will need to do what. And whether this is possible in the real world.</p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>You'll start implementing your new content strategy. I'll be there to help with training and questions. Then we'll have a sign off meeting and agree how we'll measure the success of your new content strategy. Congratulations! You now have content that is working for its keep.</p>

    	<p>Over the last ten years I’ve worked as a writer, editor, proofreader, researcher and project manager. I discovered content strategy in 2013, so I'm still developing my portfolio. I'll post examples soon, although I hope this website shows what I can do. The HTML and CSS are mine. You're also welcome to browse my writing and research portfolio <a href="http://hannahadcock.co.uk/portfolio">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>Qualifications</h3>
      <p>I have a BA in English from Cambridge University (1999-2002; 2:1) and a MSc in Global Politics from LSE (2012-2013; distinction). This means I'm used to thinking strategically about complicated material. So, whatever product you're selling or customer base you're targeting, I'll get it.</p>
