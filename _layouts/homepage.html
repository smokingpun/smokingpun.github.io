        <h2>What is Content Strategy?</h2>
        <p>You know that great content will help your users understand your product and get excited about it, as well as bumping you up the search rankings. Great! But it can be hard keeping your content under control. Sometimes it can feel as though your content is expanding so quickly that you can't keep track of what’s being published every week, let alone editing or archiving old material. As for optimising the content that you have: well, you don't really have time. And what should you look for?</p>
        <p>This is where I come in. My name is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahadcock">Hannah Adcock Neil</a> and I can help you curate your content so that it's user-focused, meaningful and future-friendly. By doing so, you'll save time because you'll only produce content that is necessary. You'll make money because curated content will turn site visitors into customers. Here's what I can do:</p>

        <h2>Analysis and Auditing</h2>
        <p>You'll tell me what your key business objectives are. I'll analyse your content – your website, social media and any publications – to see whether it's supporting these objectives and is user-friendly. I'll also do a content audit of your existing web material – or part of it at least. A content audit usually involves listing what content is on your site, where it is located and whether it is doing a good job.</p>

        <figure id="bullet-2" class="journey-bullet _jsPlumb_endpoint_anchor_">2.</figure>
        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>This is where I use Google Analytics, KISSmetrics, Crazy Egg, Topsy – basically, whatever's most relevant and fits your budget – to see what your users are doing. Are they making it through your sales funnel? Is your 'buy now' button in a place that only 10% of your users ever venture?  I'll then have a think about why your users are behaving as they are. We could also do some user-testing at this point. What do your users think of your site? Is it easy to use? What could be better?</p>

        <figure id="bullet-3" class="journey-bullet _jsPlumb_endpoint_anchor_">3.</figure>
        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>I'll produce a written report or a powerpoint presentation if you prefer. I might also run up some wireframes to show how content could be structured on key pages. Then we'll sit down over a cup of tea and develop a plan of action. I'll bring my suggestions to the table – and maybe some cake. You will too. Your content strategy has to be sustainable over the longer-term, which means working out who on your team will need to do what. And whether this is possible in the real world.</p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>You'll start implementing your new content strategy. I'll be there to help with training and questions. Congratulations! You now have content that is working for its keep. But what if you don't have the time or perhaps the in-house expertise to keep optimising your content? In this case, I can offer a few companies a monthly content strategy service. I'll be posting more details soon, but for now get in touch and we can talk it through.</p>

    	<h2>My Projects</h2>
    	<p>Over the last ten years I’ve worked as a writer, editor, proofreader, researcher and project manager. I discovered content strategy in 2013, so I'm still developing my portfolio. I'll post examples soon, although I hope this website shows what I can do. The HTML and CSS are mine. You're also welcome to browse my writing and research portfolio <a href="http://hannahadcock.co.uk/portfolio">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>Qualifications</h3>
      <p>I have a BA in English from Cambridge University (1999-2002; 2:1) and a MSc in Global Politics from LSE (2012-2013; distinction). This means I'm used to thinking strategically about complicated material. So, whatever product you're selling or customer base you're targeting, I'll get it.</p>
