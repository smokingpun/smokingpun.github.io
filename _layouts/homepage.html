This content-first approach will ensure that your website is user-friendly and tightly focused on your business goals.

        <p>If you have a low conversion rate, your company has changed its business model, or you just feel that your site is out-of-date, then you might be considering a partial or complete website redesign.

        <h2>Trying out content strategy</h2>
        <p>You might not want to make a substantial initial investment in content strategy. Fair enough. We can identify what changes to your content will offer you the greatest return on investment, given your budget and resources, in an initial discovery session. We can then work together to implement these changes and measure their success. Read more about how you can try out content strategy.</p>

        <h2>On-going content strategy support</h2>
        <p>I regularly work on one-off projects, particularly website redesigns. However, I can offer a few companies a monthly content strategy service, if you don't have a content strategist in-house. I'll integrate with your team, through a mix of remote and in-person working (depending on your location). Read more about how you can benefit from ongoing content strategy support.</p>

      <h3>How I Work</h3>
      <p>I enjoy writing in Markdown/HTML and committing to <a href="https://github.com/smokingpun">Github</a> when I'm working with tech startups. Otherwise, I tend to use GoogleDocs. I can be flexible though, and I'm happy to advise on workflow options that will streamline the content production process.</p>

      <h2>SendOwl</h2>
      <p><a href="http://sendowl.com/">SendOwl</a> is an independent ecommerce platform for digital products. George, founder of SendOwl, wanted to use content to grow the company. I've worked on various content strategy deliverables to ensure that SendOwl are consistently producing compelling, branded content. I then write and edit all copy. I've also done a content audit, gap analysis and competitor analysis to spot areas where we can achieve some 'quick wins' in terms of the website and onboarding process. We're currently working on some significant user interface improvements.</p>

I helped with user research and interpretation of the metrics. I also wireframed key pages (for different viewports), including two new landing page, as well as edited existing copy and created new copy where necessary.

      <h2>Creative Touch Beauty Studio</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.creativetouchbeauty.co.uk/">Creative Touch Beauty Studio</a> had an outdated website that wasn’t optimised for different viewports. I carried out some user research to test demand for online booking, vouchers and beauty tips. I then advised on the creation and maintenance of new content and wireframed key pages. I built the website using SquareSpace. As part of the project, I also advised on how the Studio could use content marketing to drive traffic to their new and improved website. </p>
