        <h2>How Content Strategy Can Help Your Business</h2>
        <p><b>My name is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/hannahadcock">Hannah Adcock</a> and I'm a content strategist</b>. I can help you with content pain points like these:</p>

      
        <ul class="your_problem_list">
           <li class="your_problem_copy"><i>We want to use content to grow our start-up. How can we do this? What will it cost?</i></li>
          <li class="your_problem_copy"><i>We're doing a site redesign and want to know: what content should we keep, what should we bin and what should we create?</i></li>
          <li class="your_problem_copy"><i>Most of our team produce content so our brand message can feel unfocused. How can we pull all our content together?</i></li>
        </ul>

         <p class="where_you_want_to_be_copy">What I do differs from project to project and can range from analytical to creative. Below are a few suggestions of scenarios I can help you with:</p>

        <h2>Growing your business through content</h2>
        <p>High quality, relevant content is the greatest competitive advantage you can create for yourself online. This is because content attract people to your site, explains what your product is and why people should buy it, shows that you are a credible business, and builds brand loyalty. This is an ongoing process. Read more about how you can grow your business through content.</p>

        <h2>Redesigning your website</h2>
        <p>If you have a low conversion rate, your company has changed its business model, or you just feel that your site is out-of-date, then you might be considering a partial or complete website redesign. I can help by identifying who your customers are, what information they need when, and what key messages you want to convey to them. This content-first approach will ensure that your website is user-friendly and tightly focused on your business goals. A beautifully designed website will convert badly if user need and content are given only minimum attention. Read more about how I can help you with a website redesign</p>

        <h2>Trying out content strategy</h2>
        <p>You might not want to make a substantial initial investment in content strategy. Fair enough. We can identify what changes to your content will offer you the greatest return on investment, given your budget and resources, in an initial discovery session. We can then work together to implement these changes and measure their success. Read more about how you can try out content strategy.</p>

        <h2>On-going content strategy support</h2>
        <p>I regularly work on one-off projects, particularly website redesigns. However, I can offer a few companies a monthly content strategy service, if you don't have a content strategist in-house. I'll integrate with your team, through a mix of remote and in-person working (depending on your location). Read more about how you can benefit from ongoing content strategy support.</p>

      <h3>How I Work</h3>
      <p>I enjoy writing in Markdown/HTML and committing to <a href="https://github.com/smokingpun">Github</a> when I'm working with tech startups. Otherwise, I tend to use GoogleDocs. I can be flexible though, and I'm happy to advise on workflow options that will streamline the content production process.</p>

      <h2>SendOwl</h2>
      <p><a href="http://sendowl.com/">SendOwl</a> is an independent ecommerce platform for digital products. George, founder of SendOwl, wanted to use content to grow the company. I've worked on various content strategy deliverables to ensure that SendOwl are consistently producing compelling, branded content. I then write and edit all copy. I've also done a content audit, gap analysis and competitor analysis to spot areas where we can achieve some 'quick wins' in terms of the website and onboarding process. We're currently working on some significant user interface improvements.</p>

      <p>Drew Neil, founder of <a href="http://vimcasts.org/">Vimcasts</a>, wanted to increase people's engagement with the site by making the content easier to navigate on all devices, increase traffic to the site through a broader social media strategy, and give more visibility to training, publications and pro-screencasts. I helped with user research and interpretation of the metrics. I also wireframed key pages (for different viewports), including two new landing page, as well as edited existing copy and created new copy where necessary. I've <a href="http://contentedstrategy.com/blog/">blogged about</a> my content strategy work on Vimcasts.</p>

      <h2>Creative Touch Beauty Studio</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.creativetouchbeauty.co.uk/">Creative Touch Beauty Studio</a> had an outdated website that wasnâ€™t optimised for different viewports. I carried out some user research to test demand for online booking, vouchers and beauty tips. I then advised on the creation and maintenance of new content and wireframed key pages. I built the website using SquareSpace. As part of the project, I also advised on how the Studio could use content marketing to drive traffic to their new and improved website. </p>
