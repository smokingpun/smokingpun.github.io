      <p>High quality, relevant content is the greatest competitive advantage you can create for yourself online.

         <p>If you are considering a partial or complete website redesign I can help by identifying who your customers are, what information they need when, and what key messages you want to convey to them. This content-first approach will ensure that your website is user-friendly and tightly focused on your business goals. A beautifully designed website will convert badly if user need and content are given only minimum attention.
