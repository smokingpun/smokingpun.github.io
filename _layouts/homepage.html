      <h3>Why you need content strategy to grow your startup or SME</h3>
      <p>Put simply, content strategy involves looking at all your content – not just your marketing stuff – to see what improvements will help your company grow faster.</p>

      <p>I do this by making sure I understand exactly how your company works and who your customers are. You need to know what will work for your company, and this requires strategy rather than imitation.</p>

              <p>I enjoy writing in Markdown/HTML and committing to <a href="https://github.com/smokingpun">Github</a> when I'm working with tech startups. Otherwise, I tend to use GoogleDocs. I can be flexible though, and I'm happy to advise on workflow options that will streamline the content production process.</p>
