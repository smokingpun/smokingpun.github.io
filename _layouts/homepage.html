      <p>High quality, relevant content is the greatest competitive advantage you can create for yourself online. This is because content attract people to your site, explains what your product is and why people should buy it, shows that you are a credible business, and builds brand loyalty.

         <p>If you are considering a partial or complete website redesign I can help by identifying who your customers are, what information they need when, and what key messages you want to convey to them. This content-first approach will ensure that your website is user-friendly and tightly focused on your business goals. A beautifully designed website will convert badly if user need and content are given only minimum attention. Read more about how I can help you with a website redesign</p>

      <h2>Vimcasts</h2>
      <p>Drew Neil, founder of <a href="http://vimcasts.org/">Vimcasts</a>, wanted to increase people's engagement with the site by making the content easier to navigate on all devices, increase traffic to the site through a broader social media strategy, and give more visibility to training, publications and pro-screencasts. I helped with user research and interpretation of the metrics. I also wireframed key pages (for different viewports), including two new landing page, as well as edited existing copy and created new copy where necessary. I've <a href="http://contentedstrategy.com/blog/">blogged about</a> my content strategy work on Vimcasts.</p>

      <h2>Creative Touch Beauty Studio</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.creativetouchbeauty.co.uk/">Creative Touch Beauty Studio</a> had an outdated website that wasn’t optimised for different viewports. I carried out some user research to test demand for online booking, vouchers and beauty tips. I then advised on the creation and maintenance of new content and wireframed key pages. I built the website using SquareSpace. As part of the project, I also advised on how the Studio could use content marketing to drive traffic to their new and improved website. </p>
