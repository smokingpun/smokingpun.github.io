        <p>You're probably here because you've heard people talking about content strategy. A lot of people. And it sounds like a great idea. Who doesn't want content that is user-focused, meaninful and future-friendly? And your own content – well, it's not quite there yet. No problem. You've come to the right place. My name is Hannah Adcock Neil and I'm here to help you do less, better. Here's what I can do:</p>

        <figure id="bullet-1" class="journey-bullet _jsPlumb_endpoint_anchor_">1.</figure>
        <h2>Analysis and Auditing</h2>
        <p>You'll tell me what your key business objectives are. I'll analyse your content to see whether it's supporting these objectives and is user-friendly. I'll also do a content audit of your existing material – or part of it at least – to see what your content looks like at the moment.</p>

        <figure id="bullet-2" class="journey-bullet _jsPlumb_endpoint_anchor_">2.</figure>
        <h2>Analytics</h2>
        <p>This is where I use Google Analytics, KISSmetrics, Crazy Egg, Topsy – basically, whatever's most relevant and fits your budget – to see what your users are doing. I'll then have a think about why. If you're feeling generous, then we could also do some user-testing at this point.</p>

        <figure id="bullet-3" class="journey-bullet _jsPlumb_endpoint_anchor_">3.</figure>
        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>I'll go over the results of my data crunching and anaylsis with you. Then we'll sit down over a cup of tea and develop a plan of action. I'll bring some sugestions to the table – and maybe some cake. You will too. Your content strategy has to be sustainable over the longer-term, which means working out who on your team will need to do what. And whether this is possible in the real world rather than a fantastical universe where everyone is super efficient all of the time. And technology never lets you down. Not ever.</p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>You'll start implementing your new content strategy. I'll be there to help with training and questions. Then we'll have a sign off meeting and agree how we'll measure the success of your new content strategy. Congratulations! You now have content that is working for its keep.</p>

    	<h2 id="my_projects">My Projects</h2>
    	<p>Over the last ten years I’ve worked as a writer, editor, proofreader, researcher and project manager. I discovered content strategy in 2013 so am still developing my portfolio. I'll post examples soon, although I hope this website shows what I can do. The HTML and CSS is mine, excluding the Javascript. You're also welcome to browse my writing and research portfolio <a href="http://hannahadcock.co.uk/portfolio">here</a></p>
      <h3>Qualifications</h3>
      <p>I have a BA in English from Cambridge University (1999-2002) and a MSc in Global Politics from LSE (2012-2013). This means I'm used to thinking strategically about some pretty complicated material. So, whatever product you're selling or customer base you're targeting, I'll get it.</p>
