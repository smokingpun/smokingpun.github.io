#Content strategy for startups and small businesses: <br/>The essential guide

You know that great content will help your users understand your product and get excited about it. You're pretty sure that it will make you money by turning site visitors into customers. And you know that curated content trumps more content. The only thing is you don't have the time or expertise to develop a content strategy plan in-house. 

This is where I come in. My name is Hannah Adcock and I'm going to talk you through some of the tools of our trade. It's time to make your content work harder – so you don't have to.

##Why do you need content strategy?

Content strategy can help with content pain points like these:

* We want to use content to grow our start-up. How can we do this? What would it involve? How do we hire a good copywriter?
* Our website isn't converting well, so what content should we keep, what should we bin and what should we create?
* Most of our team produce content so our brand message can feel unfocused. How can we pull all our content together?

Content strategy stops you worrying that you don't have the 'right' content or 'enough' content. Done well, it drives traffic to your website and makes you money through improved branding, social engagement, usability and SEO.

I think that all companies – from early stage startups to multinationals – can benefit from thinking strategically about their content. However, this guide is specifically aimed at post-early stage startups and small businesses that want to use content to grow their business.

Early stage tech startups may feel that it's enough to have a basic, high-converting website and to use adverts to drive traffic to it. I've heard several growth experts suggests this is a good use of resources – fair enough. 


##What is content strategy?

It's just marketing right? Or souped up copywriting? Not exactly.  

> Content strategy is the practice of planning for the creation, delivery, and governance of useful, usable content. - Kristina Halvorson.

Some content strategists also create content – like me – but this isn't obligatory or even all that usual. Content marketing is slightly different. It is:

> A marketing technique of creating and distributing relevant and valuable content to attract, acquire, and engage a clearly defined and understood target audience — with the objective of driving profitable customer action. — Joe Pulizzi. 

Marketers implement content strategies – they don't necessarily create them. Colleen Jones makes the difference clear:

> I see the main distinction between the two fields of practice as purpose. Content strategy is essential for a wide range of purposes — media products, technical support, customer service, sales, and marketing, to name a few. Content marketing focuses on strategy and implementation for — you guessed it — marketing.

I'm not saying that one is 'better' than the other or that there isn't any overlap. There clearly is – as there is with information architecture and user experience. However, my particular interest is content strategy because it's relevant to so many aspects of your business, not just marketing. 

If you want to learn more about content strategy and content marketing there is an [excellent article comparing the two][content strategy article] on the Content Strategy Forum. 

##What do content strategists do?
In terms of deliverables, here are a few things content strategists do that can help startups and small companies:

###Draw up content templates
You can create content templates for all types of pages: product pages, staff biographies, section landing pages, blog pages and so on. They are a simple way of making sure you get the information that you need from members of your team or freelancers. You can be explicit about what you want and what you don't. If you are running a blog, for example, you need to produce content that is search engine optimised, findable, looks good on different viewports and can be promoted effectively on different social media platforms. You don't just want one headline and a few paragraphs of copy. A useful blog template might include these categories:

* a few different headlines, preferably at least a short and a longer version
* a short teaser
* a long teaser
* a metadescription
* a tweet or two
* tags
* keywords
* pull out quotes
* a list of images
* an image that will work well on social media 
* a list of any images that won't work on a mobile so you'll need to serve up a cropped version
* a suggestion for the URL that is SEO optmised
* a body section including a number of short (1-3 sentence) paragraphs

  
####So, why should you bother?
Content templates mean you are more likely to produce consistent, well-structured, findable, sharable and search engine optimised content. They also make it easier for you to work with freelancers.  


###Create a content inventory or audit
A content inventory is an organised list of your web content including as much information about each piece of content as possible. A content audit is a qualitative tool that helps you figure out whether those content pieces are any good. 

####So, why should you bother?
A content inventory let's you know what content you have on your website. Even if you have a small site, you may forget what's on some of your pages or begin to take your website for granted (it's familiar; therefore it's ok). A content inventory includes basic things like:

* ID (identification number for each piece of content)
* page title
* URL
* format (text, pictures, video, and so on)
* links from/to the page

A content audit let's you see what content is performing well and what isn't. It includes extra things like:

* last update
* traffic/usage statistics
* accuracy
* usabilty
* actionability

... and so on. For categories like 'accuracy', 'usability' and 'actionability' you could use a ratings scale of 1-5, with 1 being rubbish and 5 being totally awesome. A 5* for accuracy would be awarded to a page that had factually correct and up-to-date content; a 5* for usability would be awarded to a page that gave users the information they needed, when they needed it, using appropriate language; a 5* for actionability would be awarded to a page that made it clear what action the user should take, whether that is buying a product, sharing content on social media, moving to another web page, and so on.

Once you've done an audit/inventory you can make some quickish wins by:

*  improving underperforming content that has a lousy click through rate or obvious messaging flaws
* getting a useful heads up on what content is engaging users so you can create more content in a similiar vein

You can make some longer terms wins by doing a gap analysis. This involves looking at what content you have on your website and then working out what content is missing. For example, are you strong on knowledge base articles for existing customers, but not so good on outward-facing articles that explain to potential customers how your product features will help them? 

If you're really getting into this auditing stuff, you can also do a competitor analysis, which let's you learn from your competitors, avoid their mistakes and spot areas where you can differentiate yourself. For example, if your competitor's website looks like every other Silicon Vallery startup, then you can market your business as a bit more edgy/amusing/authentic and so on. Equally, if your competitor's pricing plan is based on a % cut and yours is based on a set pricing plan consider which customers your approach would appeal to – and target them with your adverts, blog posts and social media. 

Undertake a competitor analysis with an open mind though. Not everything your competitors do is lousy!

###Determine a message architecture
According to content stratgeist Margot Bloomstein:

>  A message architecture is a hierarchy of communication goals; as a hierarchy, they're attributes that appear in order of priority, typically in an outline. 

####So, why should you bother?
A message architecture helps you develop a cohesive, consistent and even enjoyable user experience. You can't be everything to all people – and you shouldn't be. So how do you want to be perceived? As:

* Enduring, experienced and diverse
* Reliable, secure and helpful
* Friendly, customer-orientated and straighforward? 

... or something completely different? Just be careful that you *show* that you are x, y and z through your design, tone and voice, choice of images and so on. It's no use telling your customers that you are 'reliable and care about quality' and then pulling in all kinds of low-quality content through an RSS feed, which suggests the opposite!

You can establish a message architecture in a number of ways, including ['cardsorting'][cardsorting], through a Venn diagram or through a big argument fuelled by too much coffee (not recommended). For more information I'd suggest having a look at Margot Bloomstein's excellent book [*Content Strategy at Work*][content strategy at work].

Note that a message architecture is different from brand values. The latter is more an internal document, while the former are about how you communicate with your target audience. 

###Compile a style guide
This is a set of guidelines and standards mainly covering style and tone. If there is a particular style guide that you like, you can always refer to it for general queries. Then you can just write a supplementary style guide that targets issues of particular relevance to your company. 

Good style guides tend to have lots of examples (see [A List Apart's style guide][a list apart]). They may cover numbers, punctuation, preffered spellings, case and capitalisation, acronymns, sentence length, tense and call to actions. 

####So, why should you bother?
It looks unprofessional if your use of language isn't consistent, and it can seriously undermine your message architecture. For example, if a customer is browsing one page of your website that is written in a conversational tone and then clicks through to a page where the language is suddenly much more formal, what will they think? That your business is... unfocused? Or perhaps that you can't be bothered to pay attention to detail? Even if they don't consciously notice the change in tone, they will be left with a slightly fuzzy impression of your company. And this makes you easy to forget, particularly when your competitor offers a much more branded experience, in terms of design and content.

Style guides can be as large or as small as you need them to be – and this depends on the expertise of your writers. Good web writers probably don't need tips on web writing – just the useful stuff about tone and voice. Newbie writers might need more help. In which case get them to read: [*Letting Go of the Words: Writing Web Content that Works*][letting go of the words] by Janice (Ginny) Redish.

###Construct an editorial calendar
To return to Margot Bloomstein:

>  An editorial calendar lays out the plan for how the experience will continue to change over time: who will do what, where, and at what frequency? It often addresses the complete web experience, not just the site, as it can span thematic updates to -all- channels. 

####So, why should you bother?
It's easy to get caught up creating a blog post, or an advert, or managing a Twitter conversation, but it's always helpful if you know what's up next. You will grow your business by planning to create engaging, relevant content over the longer term. A one-off blog post, no matter how good, will only achieve so much.

Editorial calendars, I think, are also good for morale. You see what's going to happen in the future (Huzzah! You have a future!) as well as reminding you what you've accomplished in the past. You can also use an editorial calendar to show what content is evergreen, so can be repackaged at a later date, and what is time sensitive, so will need archiving or editing. 

You can create an editorial calendar as a table using Markdown and commit to Github. Or there are lots of spreadsheet templates online. If you hate tables and spreadsheets then you could always try an organisational tool like Asana or Trello. Whatever works for you. Useful categories in a spreadsheet might include:

* publication date
* content type
* persona (more on these in a minute)
* working title
* state
* notes
* pictures
* popularity (to be filled in retrospectively)

###Research user personas
To quote author Ginny Redish:

> A persona is an individual with a name, a picture, specific demographics, and other characteristics. A persona is, however, not usually based on one actual individual. Rather, each persona is a composite of characteristics or real people in the group the persona represents

You can use personas to breathe life into the information that you've gathered about your site visitors. And if you haven't any information on your site visitors then get gathering! Your support queue, inbox, social media, analytics and site search logs are a good place to start. 

What makes up a persona? 

* name
* age
* family status
* gender
* education level
* main tasks they complete on your website
* main information they want from your website

####So, why should you bother?
If your customers are people like you then congratulations, you're very lucky. It will be fairly easy to work out what they need. However, if your customers are not like you, or your company has a number of different types of customers, then ideally you need to work out what they need. Don't just guess! Then you can produce focused content that appeals to your customers rather than any old content that might not. I always think about what persona or personas I'm writing for when I produce a new piece of content. This way I remain focused on who I'm writing for as well as where I should promote that content.


###Mock-up wireframes
Content strategist Richard Ingram describes wireframes as:

> A simplified representation of a web page or an application screen that illustrates and describes its proposed information and structure, as well as its functional behaviors.


####So, why should you bother?
Wireframes describe what content should be on a page. Given that content is what your site visitors are most interested in, it's important that you get it sorted first before moving on to design. Wireframing also means that you can get early stage feedback and make sure that your team are on the same page in terms of what you want to achieve. It will also help your design team understand what you want them to do. However, your content will be displayed on different viewports so a static wireframe will only help you so much. Sometimes I'll wireframe for different viewports. It depends on how your design and development team work. 


##How do you get good content?
You know you need good content in the same way you need good design, good accountancy advice and good development, but how do you get it? 

###Your options

####Aggregate content
This is a feasible option if you want to access plentiful, cheap content. Just be aware that quality content that works for your organisation probably isn't going to be spotted by an algorithm. That doesn't mean don't do it: just make sure you have a human curating it. 


####Get your users to generate content
Huzzah! It's free! Well, kind of. The issue here is that you still need someone from your organistion to set the tone and curate the content. Otherwise you might end up with zilch, or with stuff that's unhelpful. To encourage users to produce quality content you could offer them a discount on your product, or a link to their blog or whatever it is they want to promote. Then be really grateful that they've taken the time to help you. 

####You'll write the content
If you're a good writer then go for it. My only word of warning is that as a company founder you'll probably have about a million other things you should be doing. So it might be more cost effective to pay a professional copywriter or marketing agency to create content while you get on with developing your business. If you're not a good writer (and let others be the judge!) then consider employing a copywriter. You'll feel a bit queasy if you get people to your website through advertising or sheer force of personality only for them to bounce off because they don't understand your copy or find it a bit 'meh'. 

####Let's pay a student/someone from India/my mate down the road
Can't you just pay someone $10 for a blog post – or even $4? Of course you can. If you are lucky, it might even be decent content. Just bear in mind that your content should differentiate you from your competitors, inform and entertain customers and generally make you look like the kind of company that someone wants to throw their money at. If your content doesn't do this it's overpriced, even at $4, because it's stopping customers getting to good content and perhaps annoying them. It's also doing nothing for you in terms of SEO because no one wants to share it or talk about it. This point is also relevant if you choose to employ an inexperienced marketing intern. If you really can't afford to pay much for content either produce less, spend time looking around for a gem of writer who is miraculously also cheap, or spend time training your intern. I'll include a list of useful books at the end.

####Okay, let's pay a freelance copywriter
If you find a good freelance copywriter you'll get good content that informs and entertains customers and that they might even want to share (huzzah!). The downside is that you'll still need to spend time, particuarly at the beginning of the relationship, making sure that your freelancer knows enough about your company to produce relevant content. You'll also need to keep checking in with them so that they remain up to date with what your company is doing and can come up with good ideas based on this information. Perhaps you can ask them to attend a monthly meeting in person or schedule a weekly Skype call?

###Working with freelance copywriters 
If you want a long and happy relationship with a freelance writer, then consider giving them: 

* a style guide
* an outline of your message architecture
* a content template
* user personas 

In addition, get them involved in helping you shape an editorial calendar. Also make sure you have a conversation about workflow. To prevent version control issues use a collaborative writing tool like GoogleDocs or Draft. Or use a Markdown-supporting text editor and get your content producers to commit to a private repo in Github. Although you'll be lucky to find a copywriter than knows Markdown/HTML/Github. I only started learning to code last year. 

####How do you spot a good freelancer?
If you like a copywriter's portfolio then that's a good start. You might also look for:

* an ability to write in different styles (avoid bloggers who can only write in their own style)
* enough interest in the job that they look at your website and make relevant suggestions 
* enough knowledge that they might bring up style, audience and workflow in your conversation
* a decent grasp of web writing best practice
* customer testimonials or similar

If you think you might struggle to 'spot' a good copywriter, perhaps because English is your second language or you're just not that into words, you could do some swotting up before hiring someone. Ginny Redish's book [*Letting Go of the Words*][letting go of the words] is the best book on the subject. [*Don't Make Me Think*][don't make me think] by Steve Krug is also a great read in terms of all things web.

You could also ask a few friends and colleagues to give you an opinion on the writer's portfolio and style. Ideally, also ask a few of your customers or potential customers to give you their opinion. After all, your copywriter will be writing for your customers, not for you. 


####Where do you find a good freelancer?
You could try online marketplaces like [Elance][elance]. Inviting people to bid on a job rather than making it open to everyone might weed out the timewasters. There are also 'talent agencies' like [Scripted][scripted]. Many copywriters have websites, although you might need to click through quite a few pages of Google to get to the independents. Or you can ask your network for recommendations on social media. Another option is to browse groups on LinkedIn and GooglePlus where freelancers hang out to see if you like the look of anyone.  For example, there is a good GooglePlus [blogging community][blogging community] where you might track down some decent freelancers.


##Create a content strategy in a week
You're interested in content strategy but you're busy people. Understood. However, you can achieve a surprising amount in a week:

Monday

* Initial discussion about what content your company is creating, who is doing it, and why
* Discuss your existing user research and create user personas


Tuesday 

* Discuss content themes – which personas are you going to target this month?
* Create content calendar for this month, and preferably a few months in advance as well


Wednesday 

* Create content templates (for example, a blog template)
* Begin to build a style guide 


Thursday

* Discuss who'll write this month's content 
* Discuss how you'll promote this month's content and who will be responsible
* Undertake a content inventory or audit, if you have time


Friday

* Decide how you'll measure the success of your content efforts (your key performance indicators)
* Discuss your content audit/inventory and see if you can make any quick wins next week
* Go to the pub
